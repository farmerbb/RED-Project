# ROM Extraction Documentation Project

## Introduction

Emulation is a great way to experience classic gaming from many different generations, as well as to preserve games and consoles that otherwise would be lost to time.  However, obtaining ROMs to run in emulators tends to be associated with the stigma of piracy and other illegal acts.  This, along with the relative difficulty of obtaining ROMs from rapidly closing websites, can be a turnoff for a lot of people to get into retro game emulation.

Nowadays, many modern game products, such as compilations, mini classic consoles, etc. actually come loaded with ROMs that, with a bit of technical know-how, can be extracted and run on any compatible emulator.  The ROM Extraction Documentation Project serves to be a repository of information and tools for legally obtaining ROMs from products you may already own, to run on any emulator of your choosing.
